Unable to switch to attendance list.  there is some text that cannot be read that gets displayed. (I think it is "Take Attendance"). We previously had an attendance panel with buttons and everything.  that's what should open when you "switch"
The Lap boxes have a glow, but the data that was previously saved is not getting pulled in.  And i am unable to do anything when i click on the button.
I was able to update the Weekly Lap page and then access the lap tracker.
I can see small splitting of the desks when the laps are selected. But I am still seeing an Attendance version of the desk instead of the tracker version. Therefore, i cannot test if the clickzones are aligned or not - but please check.
And the buttons to select the laps look just like  the other buttons.  It is not visually obvious that these are the buttons to select to turn on/off display (and i do NOT want text to explain it!).  And they are resizing on this page based on text length.
Name your laps page- This should be well layed out so that the 15 text boxes are filling 75%+ of the screen.  And they should be fixed sized containers that allow text wrapping internally;
Remove the word About on the About Page.
Remove "Resume today's class" and "Monitor" and "Jump into today's seating view" text on Dashboard Page.
The Setup/Manage Student page is ridiculous. For some reason the student name box wants to take up most of the real estate here and it scrunched down the black name to nearly invisiable and pushed the buttons off screen to the right.
Desk setup with circles: the circles and names all sit in a container that has padding.  reduce the padding there to minimal.  And increase the size of the circles (visually) by 50%.
