Switch to Attendance List results in no action on screen.  
The Update Attendance button isn't working as intended. It should be a toggle switch to allow attendance to be updated after the fact.  During Attendance (initial or update), the desk should Only show student name and be clickable for attendance only (no circles).  no other buttons, except the "Home" button should be disabled during attendance.  It should be visually different than the Lap View.
When student is marked Absent, remove the word Absent and update the red color to be stronger red.

Once Attendance is complete or updated, then return to Lap View.  In Lap View the only visual indicator from attendance view that remains is if a student is absent.  In that case, the student should be visibly "removed" from the desk.

The Laps, when named, need to wrap inside of their current buttons.  And they shouldn't look like smaller buttons that Attendance!

It should be clear that you need to toggle these buttons on in order to start tracking.  There is no visual difference when a lap is selected or not.

And everywhere I click, there seems to be a small visual lag or twitch, as it rotates through cycles.
